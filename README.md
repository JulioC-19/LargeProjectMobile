## SetupðŸ’»

1. Inside the project folder, install node_modules

```
npm install 
```
2. Start metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. Metro "takes in an entry file and various options, and returns a single JavaScript file that includes all your code and its dependencies."â€” Metro Docs
Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal

```
npm run start
```

3. Open a new terminal inside the project folder and run android

```
npm run android
```

> Alternative, you can also run on iOS, just replace android with ios in step 3.
> Currently, the project is being developed only on Android.
